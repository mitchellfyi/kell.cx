GitHub Copilot isn't the only game in town anymore. Whether you're hitting usage limits, frustrated with the VS Code lock-in, or just curious what else is out there—here are the best alternatives worth your attention in 2026.

## Why Look Beyond Copilot?

Don't get me wrong: Copilot is fine. It's integrated everywhere, your company might already pay for it, and it generally works.

But "fine" isn't "great." The competition has moved fast. Agent capabilities, multi-file understanding, truly unlimited free tiers—features Copilot still struggles with.

Here's what's actually worth switching to.

---

## 1. Cursor

**Price:** $20/month Pro, $40/seat Business  
**Best for:** Developers who want the best experience and can handle a new editor

Cursor took VS Code, forked it, and rebuilt the AI experience from scratch. The result is the most polished AI coding tool available.

**Why it's great:**
- Composer understands your entire codebase, not just open files
- Tab completion feels psychic—it predicts multi-line edits accurately
- Agent mode handles complex, multi-file refactors
- Rapid iteration: weekly updates that actually improve things

**The catch:**
500 "fast" requests per month on Pro. Power users hit this by week three. You're also locked into their VS Code fork, which mostly but not always works with your extensions.

**Verdict:** Worth the switch if you write code 6+ hours a day.

## 2. Windsurf (Codeium)

**Price:** Free unlimited, $10/month Pro  
**Best for:** Budget-conscious developers who want solid AI without limits

Windsurf is Codeium's answer to Cursor—another VS Code fork with AI built deep into the editor. The killer feature? Actually unlimited completions on the free tier.

**Why it's great:**
- Free tier that's genuinely unlimited, no asterisks
- Pro at $10/month—half the price of Cursor
- Cascade flow engine handles multi-file edits well
- No request counting, no throttling anxiety

**The catch:**
It's not quite as polished as Cursor. Completions are good but not best-in-class. Agent mode has rougher edges. But at the price point, it's hard to complain.

**Verdict:** The best value in AI coding tools right now.

## 3. Continue.dev

**Price:** Free (open source)  
**Best for:** Developers who want full control and BYO API keys

Continue is the open-source alternative. Install it in VS Code or JetBrains, bring your own API keys (OpenAI, Anthropic, local models), and customize everything.

**Why it's great:**
- Open source—inspect the code, run it locally, no telemetry
- Use any model: GPT-4, Claude, Llama, Mistral, whatever
- Highly customizable context and prompts
- Growing extension ecosystem

**The catch:**
You're on your own for API costs. Running Claude Opus through Continue can get expensive fast. Also requires more setup than plug-and-play tools.

**Verdict:** Perfect for developers who distrust black boxes or need specific models.

## 4. Cody (Sourcegraph)

**Price:** Free for individuals, $9/seat Pro  
**Best for:** Teams with large, complex codebases

Sourcegraph built Cody on top of their code search infrastructure. The result is an AI that actually understands your entire repository—not just the files you have open.

**Why it's great:**
- Deep codebase awareness from Sourcegraph's indexing
- Works in VS Code, JetBrains, and Neovim
- Strong context retrieval for questions about unfamiliar code
- Enterprise features for large organizations

**The catch:**
The free tier limits premium requests. Context quality depends heavily on how well Sourcegraph indexes your repo. Can feel slower than local-first tools.

**Verdict:** Best for joining a new team or navigating unfamiliar codebases.

---

## 5. Amazon Q Developer (formerly CodeWhisperer)

**Price:** Free tier, $19/month Pro  
**Best for:** AWS-heavy shops and those avoiding Microsoft

Amazon's entry—rebranded from CodeWhisperer—is solid if unspectacular. The main draw is deep AWS integration and a genuinely useful free tier.

**Why it's great:**
- Free tier with reasonable limits (50 suggestions/day on chat)
- First-class AWS service integration
- Reference tracking for open-source attribution
- Security scanning built-in

**The catch:**
It's Amazon. The UX reflects that enterprise DNA. Agent capabilities lag behind Cursor and Windsurf. The VS Code extension can feel clunky.

**Verdict:** Makes sense if you're already deep in AWS and want one vendor.

## 6. Tabnine

**Price:** Free tier, $12/month Pro  
**Best for:** Enterprises with strict data privacy requirements

Tabnine was doing AI completions before Copilot existed. Their focus now is privacy: they offer fully local models and self-hosted options for enterprises that can't send code to external APIs.

**Why it's great:**
- Local model option—code never leaves your machine
- Self-hosted enterprise deployment
- Works across most editors (VS Code, JetBrains, Vim, etc.)
- Personalized to your coding style

**The catch:**
The AI quality has fallen behind. Local models can't match cloud offerings. If privacy isn't your primary concern, there are better options.

**Verdict:** Choose it for privacy, not for the best AI.

## 7. Supermaven

**Price:** Free tier, $10/month Pro  
**Best for:** Developers who prioritize completion speed above all

Supermaven's pitch is simple: the fastest completions in the industry. Their custom-built model prioritizes latency over everything else.

**Why it's great:**
- Completions appear almost instantly—noticeable vs. competitors
- 300,000 token context window (largest available)
- Growing feature set with chat and multi-file support
- Free tier that's actually useful

**The catch:**
Newer product, still adding features. Agent capabilities are nascent. Smaller company means less certain long-term.

**Verdict:** Try it if completion latency drives you crazy.

---

## Which Should You Choose?

**For most developers:** Start with Windsurf. It's free, unlimited, and good enough to assess if you even need to pay for anything.

**For power users:** Cursor is the premium choice. Worth $20/month if you code professionally.

**For privacy-focused:** Continue.dev (open source, your keys) or Tabnine (local models).

**For enterprises:** Cody if you need codebase understanding, Amazon Q if you're AWS-native, Cursor Business if you want the best product.

## The Bottom Line

Copilot's first-mover advantage is fading. The alternatives aren't just catching up—in several areas, they've pulled ahead.

Try a few. Most have free tiers. The switching cost is lower than you think, and the productivity gains from a better tool compound daily.
