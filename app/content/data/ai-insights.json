      "summary": "GPT-5 tops the benchmark leaderboard (score 88) while offering tiered cost points (high $29.08, medium $17.69, low $10.37), demonstrating the best balance of capability and cost-efficiency in this suite. This matters because developer tooling and integrations will favor models that maximize accuracy per dollar, making GPT-5 a likely default for many AI coding workflows.",

The result is clear segmentation: vendors will choose models for specific strengths (formatting, long context) even when they are more expensive.",
