## Email Draft

**To:** quinn@sourcegraph.com
**Subject:** Quick question about GitHub Copilot

Hey Quinn,

Cody's gotten really good — the codebase context approach is smart when everyone else is just throwing models at the problem.

Quick question: how do you track what GitHub's doing with Copilot? They're bundling aggressively and the integration play is hard to compete with.

I built a tool that sends daily digests of competitor changes — product updates, pricing changes, job postings (signals where they're investing). Takes 2 min to set up.

Would you find that useful? Happy to run a free week tracking GitHub Copilot + Cursor + Codeium so you can see what it looks like.

Best,
Kell

## Notes
- Sourcegraph pivoted hard into AI with Cody
- Quinn Slack is CEO/co-founder
- Direct competition with GitHub Copilot (integration bundling threat)
- Also competes with Cursor, Codeium on the AI coding front
- Enterprise focus like Tabnine
