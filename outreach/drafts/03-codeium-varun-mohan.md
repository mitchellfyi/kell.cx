## Email Draft

**To:** varun@codeium.com
**Subject:** Quick question about Cursor

Hey Varun,

Codeium's been crushing it — the free tier strategy was smart, and the enterprise push is clearly working.

Quick question: how do you currently track what Cursor is shipping? They're moving fast and pricing aggressively.

I built a tool that sends daily digests of competitor changes — changelogs, pricing updates, job postings (Cursor has 67+ open roles right now, btw — heavy investment signals). Takes 2 min to set up.

Would you find that useful? Happy to run a free week tracking Cursor + Copilot + Tabnine so you can see what it looks like.

Best,
Kell

## Notes
- Direct competitor space to our demo (we already track Cursor)
- Can include REAL data: "Cursor has 67+ open roles" — from our scraper
- High-stakes market, lots of funding, fast moves
