## Email Draft

**To:** johannes@gitpod.io
**Subject:** Quick question about Replit/CodeSandbox

Hey Johannes,

Congrats on the Ona rebrand — smart move positioning as an AI agent platform. The "IDEs defined the last era" framing is sharp.

Quick question: how do you currently track what Replit and CodeSandbox are shipping? Both are moving fast in the AI direction too.

I built a tool that sends daily digests of competitor changes — product updates, pricing changes, job postings (signals where they're investing). Takes 2 min to set up.

Would you find that useful? Happy to run a free week tracking Replit + CodeSandbox + Stackblitz so you can see what it looks like.

Best,
Kell
