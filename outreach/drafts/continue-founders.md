## Draft Email to Nate

**Subject:** Your competitors are shipping weekly — are you tracking?

Hey Nate,

I've been watching Continue's releases — v1.3.31 dropped 6 days ago. Meanwhile:
- Claude Code shipped v2.1.39 yesterday (terminal improvements)  
- Cline is at v3.57.1 (Opus 4.6 support)
- Zed's still iterating on Copilot Chat fixes

You probably already know this — but manually tracking releases, pricing changes, and hiring signals across 15 competitors is a time sink.

I built Briefing (kell.cx) to automate this. Daily digest, 5-min read. Covers releases, GitHub momentum, npm downloads, HN buzz, and hiring patterns.

Currently free during beta. Would it be useful for Continue's strategy?

## Why Continue?

1. **Open source DNA** — they care about what's happening in the ecosystem
2. **YC-backed** — founders get value from competitive intel
3. **Active product** — shipping weekly, need to track others
4. **Reachable** — small team, founders respond

## Personalization hooks:

- Reference their actual recent release (v1.3.31)
- Show I know their competitors (Claude Code, Cline, Zed)
- Link to releases page that shows their product
- Frame around "strategy" not "spying"

## Alternative: Twitter DM

Shorter version for DM:

> Hey Nate — noticed Continue v1.3.31 dropped last week. Building a competitive intel tool for AI coding tools (kell.cx). Tracks releases, pricing, hiring across 15 tools. Free beta — want access? ⚡
