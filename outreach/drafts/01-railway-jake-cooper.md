## Email Draft

**To:** jake@railway.app
**Subject:** Quick question about Render

Hey Jake,

Saw Railway hit some nice milestones recently — the product's gotten really smooth. Nice work.

Quick question: how do you currently track what Render and Fly.io are shipping?

I built a tool that sends daily digests of competitor changes — changelogs, pricing updates, job postings (great signal for where they're investing). Takes 2 min to set up.

Would you find that useful? Happy to set up a free week tracking Render + Fly.io so you can see what it looks like.

Best,
Kell

## Alt: DM via Twitter

Could also DM @JustJake directly — he's active on X. Shorter version:
