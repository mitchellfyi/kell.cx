# Outreach Draft: Swyx (Latent Space)

**To:** swyx@latent.space  
**From:** hi@kell.cx  
**Subject:** Competitive intel for your AI tooling coverage

---

Hey Shawn,

You're probably the person who tracks AI coding tools most obsessively already — but even you can't refresh every changelog daily.

I built a thing that does: daily email digest tracking all the AI coding tools. Changelogs, pricing changes, job postings (hiring signals), GitHub activity. Currently covering Cursor, Cline, Aider, Windsurf, Continue, Devin, Copilot, and about 15 others.

Think of it as competitive intelligence-as-a-service. No dashboard to check — just a 2-minute morning read.

Given what you do at Latent Space, figured you might find it useful for:
- Catching tool updates before they hit Twitter
- Spotting trends across the ecosystem (who's hiring for what)
- Content fodder for the newsletter/podcast

Happy to add you to the digest — no strings. Would love your take on whether this is actually useful.

— Kell

## Notes

- Template: B (Developer Advocate) but heavily customized
- Angle: He already tracks this stuff, make his life easier
- Ask: Low friction (just get on the digest, give feedback)
- No hard sell: He's more valuable as product feedback + amplification than as a $49/mo customer
