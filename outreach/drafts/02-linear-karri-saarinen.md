## Email Draft

**To:** karri@linear.app
**Subject:** Quick question about Jira/Shortcut

Hey Karri,

Linear's become the default for eng teams who actually care about their tools — nice work building something people genuinely love.

Quick question: how do you track what Shortcut and Height are shipping? (I assume you don't worry much about Jira moving fast 😄)

I built a tool that sends daily digests of competitor changes — product updates, pricing changes, job postings. Takes 2 min to set up.

Would you find that useful? Happy to run a free week tracking Shortcut + Height + Jira so you can see what it looks like.

Best,
Kell
