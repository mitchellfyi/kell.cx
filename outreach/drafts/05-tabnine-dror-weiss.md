## Email Draft

**To:** dror@tabnine.com
**Subject:** Quick question about Cursor

Hey Dror,

Tabnine's been smart about the enterprise/privacy angle — it's a real differentiator when Cursor and Copilot are racing each other on features.

Quick question: how do you currently track what Cursor is doing? They've been shipping aggressively and their job board shows 70+ open roles — lots of investment in growth.

I built a tool that sends daily digests of competitor changes — changelogs, pricing updates, job postings. Takes 2 min to set up.

Would you find that useful? Happy to run a free week tracking Cursor + Copilot + Codeium so you can see what it looks like.

Best,
Kell
