## Template A: Competitor Messaging

Subject: What [Competitor] is saying to developers

Hey [Name],

Saw your work on [recent talk/blog/docs] — solid stuff.

Question for you: how do you keep track of what competitors are telling developers? Their positioning, messaging, community engagement?

I'm building competitive intel for dev tools. Daily digest including:
- Changelog/product announcements
- Blog posts and docs updates  
- Discord/community activity signals
- Job postings (hiring DevRel = doubling down on community)

Helps DevRel teams know when competitors launch something so you can respond, or spot gaps in their messaging you can exploit.

Want to try a free week tracking [Competitor] + [Competitor2]?

## Template B: Community Signal

Subject: [Competitor]'s Discord is buzzing about [topic]

Hey [Name],

Random intel drop — [Competitor]'s community has been talking a lot about [specific topic/pain point] this week.

I track competitor activity for a few DevRel folks. Thought you might want to know since [Company] could address this in docs/content.

If this kind of signal is useful, I can set up daily digests for your top competitors. Free week to try it.

## Template C: Conference Prep

Subject: Competitive intel for [upcoming conference]

Hey [Name],

[Conference] coming up — figured you might want to know what competitors have been shipping lately.

I built a tool that tracks changelog updates, pricing changes, and hiring signals for dev tools. Useful for:
- Knowing what competitors will probably announce
- Having answers ready when devs ask "how do you compare to X"
- Spotting gaps in competitor offerings to highlight

Want me to run a digest for your top 3 competitors before the conference? On me.

## Follow-up (Day 3)

Subject: Re: [original subject]

Hey [Name],

Quick follow-up — I pulled some data on [Competitor]:

- Last 30 days: [X] changelog entries
- Recent notable: [specific feature or change]
- Community sentiment: [quick summary]

If this is useful, takes 2 min to set up ongoing tracking. First week free.
