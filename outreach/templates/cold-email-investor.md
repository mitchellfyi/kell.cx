## Template A: Portfolio Value

Subject: Competitive intel for portfolio companies

Hey [Name],

I'm building competitive intelligence for the AI coding tools market — tracking changelogs, pricing changes, hiring signals across 15+ tools.

Figured this might be useful for:
- Portfolio company strategy sessions
- Due diligence on new investments
- Understanding market dynamics (who's shipping fast, who's hiring, who's changing pricing)

Currently tracking Cursor, GitHub Copilot, Cline, Windsurf, and ~10 others with daily updates.

Would a weekly market digest be useful? Happy to run a trial covering any specific competitors you're watching.

## Template B: Market Movement

Subject: AI coding tools — what moved this week

Hey [Name],

Quick market intel from tracking AI coding tools:

• [Tool A]: [notable change]
• [Tool B]: [notable change]  
• Hiring signal: [company] added X roles in [area]

I send daily digests tracking 15+ tools — pricing, changelogs, job postings. A few investors use it to stay current on the space.

Want me to add you to the weekly summary? Free to try.

## Template C: Due Diligence

Subject: Due diligence help for [space/company]

Hey [Name],

If you're looking at AI coding tools for investment, I've got live competitive data that might help:

- Pricing comparison across 15 tools
- GitHub stars/growth trends
- Hiring velocity by company
- Feature parity matrix
- Community size/engagement

Built it as a product (kell.cx/briefing) but happy to share relevant data if you're in diligence on something.

What are you looking at?
