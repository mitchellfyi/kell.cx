## Template A: Pain Point

Subject: Quick question about [Competitor]

Hey [Name],

Saw you're building [Product] - nice work on [specific recent thing].

Quick question: how do you currently track what [Competitor] is shipping? 

I built a tool that sends daily digests of competitor changes - changelogs, pricing updates, job postings (great signal for where they're investing). Takes 2 min to set up.

Would you find that useful? Happy to set up a free week tracking [Competitor] + [Competitor2] so you can see what it looks like.

Best,
Kell

## Template B: News Hook

Subject: [Competitor] just [did something]

Hey [Name],

Don't know if you saw, but [Competitor] just [specific change from our tracking].

I track competitor updates for a few dev tool founders - thought you might want to know since you're in the same space.

If you want, I can add [Company] to the daily digest. Free for the first week, then $49/competitor/month if it's useful.

Let me know,
Kell

## Template C: Direct Value

Subject: Daily intel on [Competitor1], [Competitor2], [Competitor3]

Hey [Name],

Building competitive intel for startups. Every morning you'd get:

• Changelog/product updates from competitors
• Pricing page changes (before your customers notice)
• New job postings (shows where they're investing)

$49/mo per competitor. Takes 2 min to set up.

Want me to run a free week for [Company] tracking [Competitor]?
