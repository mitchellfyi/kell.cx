# Outreach Templates

Email templates for different Briefing customer personas.

## Templates

## Usage

1. **Personalize heavily** — Generic = ignored. Reference specific:
   - Recent product launch or blog post
   - Specific competitor they're likely watching
   - Something from their LinkedIn/Twitter

2. **Use real data** — Include actual insights from our tracking:
   - "[Competitor] shipped X yesterday"
   - "They added 12 engineering roles this month"
   - "Pricing changed from $X to $Y"

3. **A/B test subjects** — Each template has 3 subject line options

4. **Follow-up matters** — 80% of replies come from follow-ups
