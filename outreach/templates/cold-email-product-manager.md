## Template A: Roadmap Intel

Subject: How do you track [Competitor]'s roadmap?

Hey [Name],

Product question — how does your team currently keep tabs on what [Competitor] is shipping?

I'm building competitive intelligence for dev tools. Daily digest of:
- Changelog updates (what they shipped)
- Pricing changes (before sales hears about it from prospects)
- Job postings (signals what they're building next)

Engineers hiring for "AI code review" = that feature is ~6 months out.

Would a daily email with this be useful for your roadmap planning? Happy to run a free week tracking your top 2-3 competitors.

## Template B: Feature Launch Hook

Subject: [Competitor] shipped [feature] yesterday

Hey [Name],

Quick heads up — [Competitor] just launched [specific feature from tracking].

I track competitor changelogs for a few PM teams. Figured you'd want to know since [Product] is in the same space.

Want me to add you to the daily digest? Covers changelogs, pricing updates, and hiring signals. Free for the first week.

## Template C: Battle Card Pain

Subject: Keeping battle cards fresh

Hey [Name],

Random question — how often do your competitive battle cards go stale?

Most teams I talk to update them quarterly (if that). Meanwhile competitors ship weekly.

I built a tool that sends daily competitor updates — changelogs, pricing, job posts. A few PMs use it to keep their battle cards current without the manual research.

Worth a 5-min demo? Or I can just add [Competitor] to a free week trial and you can see what it looks like.
