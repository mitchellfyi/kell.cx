## Email Templates

### Template A: Product Manager (Cold)

**Subject:** Your competitors shipped 3 updates last week

Hi [Name],

I track AI coding tools professionally — pricing changes, feature launches, GitHub activity, community sentiment.

Last week, [Competitor] updated their pricing and [Other Competitor] shipped a major feature. Your team probably saw one of those, maybe both. But what about the 20 other signals that matter for product decisions?

I'm building **Briefing** — a weekly competitive intelligence report for dev tools teams. Real data: GitHub stars, npm downloads, pricing history, release notes. No AI hallucinations.

I'm looking for 5 early users to shape the product. If you're spending more than an hour a week on competitor research, this might save you time.

Would a 15-min call this week make sense?

### Template B: Developer Advocate (Cold)

**Subject:** What devs are actually saying about AI coding tools

Hi [Name],

Your content on [specific topic] caught my attention — you clearly have your finger on the pulse.

I'm building something you might find useful: **Briefing**, a weekly competitive intelligence digest for AI coding tools. I aggregate GitHub activity, npm downloads, Hacker News discussions, pricing changes, and release notes across 15+ tools.

Not selling you anything — I'm looking for devrel folks who would find early access valuable. If you're interested, I'll add you to the beta list.

Either way, keep shipping great content.

### Template C: Startup Founder (Cold)

**Subject:** Skip the $50K analyst report

Hi [Name],

Gartner wants $50K for a Magic Quadrant on AI coding tools. You probably don't need that — you need to know what your competitors are doing *this week*.

I'm Kell. I track AI coding tools full-time and publish a weekly competitive intelligence briefing:
- Pricing changes (who raised, who lowered, new tiers)
- GitHub activity (stars, forks, commit velocity)
- Community sentiment (HN, Twitter, Discord)
- Feature launches and release notes

Currently offering early access at $49/month (vs. the $200/month I'll charge later).

Interested? Reply and I'll send a sample.

### Template D: VC / Investor (Cold)

**Subject:** Weekly signal on AI dev tools market

Hi [Name],

You've invested in [portfolio company in dev tools space], so you're clearly watching the AI coding tools market.

I publish **Briefing** — weekly competitive intelligence on 15+ AI coding tools. Real data: GitHub stars, npm downloads, pricing changes, feature launches, community growth. No vibes, just signal.

If you're tracking this market for deal flow or portfolio support, this might be useful.

Happy to send a sample briefing — just reply.

### Template E: Follow-up (After No Response)

**Subject:** Re: [Original Subject]

Hey [Name],

Just bumping this — I know inboxes are brutal.

The short version: I track AI coding tools and publish weekly competitive intelligence. If that's useful, I'd love to get you on the early access list.

If not, no worries — feel free to ignore and I won't follow up again.

## Channels to Try

1. **Direct email** — Best for PMs and founders
2. **LinkedIn** — Good for VCs and DevRel
3. **Twitter DM** — For active DevRel folks
4. **HN "Who's Hiring" threads** — Find companies hiring for competitive intelligence
5. **Product Hunt launch** — When ready for broader awareness

## Notes

- Always personalize with something specific (their content, their company, their portfolio)
- Keep it short — busy people don't read walls of text
- One CTA only — either "reply" or "book a call", not both
- Follow up once, max twice
- Track responses in a spreadsheet
