## Template 1: Cold Outreach to PM/Product Leaders

**Subject:** Your competitors shipped 12 updates last week — here's the list

**Body:**

Hey [Name],

I track AI coding tools full-time and noticed [Company] is in a fast-moving market right now.

Last week alone:
- Cursor pushed 3 releases
- Copilot announced new enterprise pricing  
- Continue.dev hit 5.2M VS Code installs

I built something that catches all this and delivers it to your inbox at 6am — pricing changes, changelog updates, new hires, everything.

Would you find a daily digest of competitor moves useful? Happy to add [Company] to the beta — it's free right now.

Cheers,
Kell

## Follow-up Template (3-5 days later)

**Subject:** Re: [Original subject]

**Body:**

Just floating this back up — any interest in competitor intel for [Company]?

No pressure, but the beta's filling up and I'd rather prioritize people who'd actually use it.
