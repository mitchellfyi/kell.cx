Pricing in this market is deliberately confusing. "Unlimited" doesn't mean unlimited. "Free" comes with asterisks. Enterprise tiers exist to extract maximum revenue from companies that don't read the fine print.

Here's the actual breakdown.

## The Pricing Tiers

The market has settled into a pattern:

| Tier | Range | What You Get |
|------|-------|--------------|
| Free | $0 | Rate-limited, smaller models, usage caps |
| Individual | $10-20/mo | Full-speed models, reasonable limits |
| Team | $19-40/user/mo | Admin controls, SSO, audit logs |
| Enterprise | $40-100+/user/mo | Everything above, plus compliance theater |

The jump from Individual to Team often adds minimal features for nearly double the cost. This is margin extraction, not value delivery.

## Tool-by-Tool Breakdown

### Cursor

- **Free**: 2,000 completions/month, 50 slow requests
- **Pro**: $20/month — 500 fast requests, unlimited slow
- **Business**: $40/user/month — team features, admin console

The 500 fast request limit is the real story here. Power users burn through this by day 15. You're then choosing between slow responses or paying for additional request packs.

Cursor's value proposition assumes you'll use it as your primary editor. If you're still in VS Code for some tasks, you're paying for two environments.

### GitHub Copilot

- **Free**: Students and OSS maintainers only
- **Individual**: $10/month or $100/year
- **Business**: $19/user/month
- **Enterprise**: $39/user/month

The $10/month individual tier is the market's price anchor. Everything else is compared to it.

Business tier adds organization-wide policy management and excludes your code from training (supposedly). Enterprise adds SAML SSO, which costs Microsoft nothing but justifies doubling the price.

### Windsurf (Codeium)

- **Free**: Unlimited completions
- **Pro**: $10/month — priority models, more agent actions
- **Team**: $25/user/month

The unlimited free tier is genuinely unlimited. This is a user acquisition strategy, not sustainable economics. Enjoy it while it lasts.

Their Pro tier undercuts Cursor by 50% while offering comparable features. The pressure this puts on the market is significant.

### Aider

- **Price**: Free (open source)
- **Actual cost**: Your API spend

Aider is free. You pay your LLM provider directly—Anthropic, OpenAI, or local inference. This is the most transparent model in the market.

Typical monthly cost for active use: $20-50 in API fees. Heavy users might hit $100+. Light users might spend $5.

The economics invert above ~$30/month in API spend. At that point, you're paying more than Cursor Pro but getting more flexibility and no request limits.

### Continue

- **Price**: Free (open source)
- **Actual cost**: Your API spend, or free with local models

Similar model to Aider but as a VS Code/JetBrains extension rather than terminal-first. The local model support makes it genuinely free if you're willing to run inference yourself.

Enterprise support is available for companies that need vendor relationships.

### Cline

- **Price**: Free (open source)
- **Actual cost**: Your API spend

Agent-focused architecture means higher API costs per task but more autonomous capability. Budget accordingly—Cline can burn through tokens faster than completion-focused tools.

## The Hidden Costs

What the pricing pages don't tell you:

**Request throttling.** "Unlimited" often means "rate-limited after threshold." Cursor's slow requests are slow enough to break flow state. Copilot throttles aggressively during peak hours.

**Model downgrades.** Free tiers often route to smaller, faster, worse models. The completions are "unlimited" because they're cheaper to serve.

**Context limits.** Cheaper tiers often have smaller context windows. This matters enormously for large codebases. You might pay $20/month and still not get full-repo context.

**Seat minimums.** Team and enterprise tiers often require minimum seat counts. A 5-person startup might need to buy 10 seats.

## What Should You Actually Pay?

Depends on your situation:

**Solo developer, budget-conscious:**  
Use Codeium free tier for completions. Add Aider with Claude API for complex tasks. Total: ~$20/month in API costs.

**Solo developer, maximize productivity:**  
Cursor Pro ($20/month). The integrated experience is worth the premium over cobbling together tools.

**Small team (2-10):**  
GitHub Copilot Business ($19/user/month) if you need enterprise compliance. Cursor Pro individual seats if you don't—it's cheaper and often better.

**Large team:**  
You'll end up on Copilot Enterprise because your security team will insist on it. Budget $40-50/user/month including all the compliance add-ons.

## The Arbitrage Opportunity

Right now, there's a gap between what tools charge and what the underlying APIs cost. BYOK tools exploit this.

Claude API (Sonnet) costs roughly $3 per million input tokens, $15 per million output tokens. A heavy coding session might use 100K input tokens and 50K output tokens. That's $1.05.

A Cursor Pro subscription costs $20/month. If you're doing fewer than 20 heavy sessions per month, BYOK tools are cheaper. If you're doing more, subscriptions win.

The tools don't want you to do this math.
