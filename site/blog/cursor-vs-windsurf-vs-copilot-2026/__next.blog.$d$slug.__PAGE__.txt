Everyone asks this question. The answer depends on who you are and what you need.

Here's the honest breakdown.

## The Quick Answer

- **Copilot** if your company is already paying for GitHub Enterprise
- **Cursor** if you want the most polished experience and don't mind limits
- **Windsurf** if you want unlimited usage and can tolerate some rough edges

Now let's dig into why.

## GitHub Copilot

**Price:** $10/month individual, $19/seat business

**The case for Copilot:**
It's everywhere. VS Code, JetBrains, Neovim, Visual Studio—Copilot works where you already work. No new editor, no migration, no workflow disruption.

For enterprises, it's the path of least resistance. Procurement knows GitHub. Legal has approved Microsoft. The $19/seat is invisible in the budget.

**The case against:**
Copilot is playing defense, not offense. They were first, they're biggest, and they're resting on it. The Chat experience is mediocre compared to competitors. Multi-file awareness is inconsistent. Agent capabilities lag behind.

**Best for:** Large teams with existing Microsoft/GitHub relationships. Developers who refuse to switch editors.

## Cursor

**Price:** $20/month Pro, $40/seat Business

**The case for Cursor:**
Best-in-class UX. The "just works" factor is real. Composer understands your whole codebase in ways Copilot doesn't. Tab autocomplete feels psychic. Agent mode, while imperfect, is ahead of the pack.

The team clearly uses their own product. Updates ship weekly. Rough edges get sanded. There's a velocity here that Copilot and Windsurf can't match.

**The case against:**
The 500 fast request limit on Pro is a real constraint. Power users hit it by mid-month and either suffer through slow requests or pay for request packs.

You're also locked into their fork of VS Code. Extensions mostly work, but "mostly" isn't "always." If you heavily customize your editor, expect friction.

**Best for:** Solo developers and small teams who prioritize quality over cost. Anyone doing complex, multi-file work.

## Windsurf (Codeium)

**Price:** Free unlimited, $10/month Pro

**The case for Windsurf:**
Unlimited free completions. Actually unlimited, not "unlimited with asterisks." If you're burning through Cursor's limits or tired of paying $20/month, Windsurf is compelling.

The Pro tier at $10/month—half of Cursor—includes agent capabilities that are genuinely useful. Cascade, their flow engine, handles multi-file edits reasonably well.

**The case against:**
It's not as polished. Completions are good but not quite Cursor-good. Agent mode has more rough edges. The editor itself (another VS Code fork) feels less refined.

You're also betting on Codeium's business model. Unlimited free is a user acquisition strategy, not sustainable economics. At some point, this changes.

**Best for:** Budget-conscious developers. Teams that can't justify $20/seat. Anyone frustrated by usage limits.

## Head-to-Head Comparison

| Feature | Copilot | Cursor | Windsurf |
|---------|---------|--------|----------|
| Monthly cost (individual) | $10 | $20 | Free or $10 |
| Usage limits | Throttled | 500 fast req | Unlimited |
| Multi-file awareness | Basic | Excellent | Good |
| Agent mode | Limited | Advanced | Good |
| Editor | VS Code extension | Fork | Fork |
| Enterprise features | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| BYOK support | No | Yes | No |

## The Emerging Alternative: Open Source + BYOK

There's a fourth path: skip the subscriptions entirely.

**Aider** (terminal) or **Continue** (VS Code/JetBrains) let you bring your own API key. You pay Anthropic or OpenAI directly—no markup, no limits except what you can afford.

For light users, this can be cheaper: $5-15/month in API costs. For heavy users, it can be more expensive: $50-100/month. The breakeven point is roughly 30 hours of heavy use per month.

The tradeoff is setup friction and less integration polish. But you own your workflow, and you're not subject to anyone's business model changes.

**Best for:** Developers who want maximum control. Anyone already comfortable with API usage.

## So What Should You Pick?

**If you're at a company with > 50 engineers:**
Copilot. It'll be mandated anyway. Accept it.

**If you're at a startup (< 20 people):**
Cursor if you can afford $20/seat, Windsurf if you can't. The productivity difference is real but not existential.

**If you're solo:**
Try Windsurf free tier for a week. If it feels limiting, try Cursor Pro. If you're technical enough to not need hand-holding, consider Aider + Claude API.

**If you're price-sensitive but need power:**
Windsurf Pro at $10/month is the value play. You give up some polish for half the cost.

## What We're Watching

This market moves fast. Some signals we're tracking:

- **Cursor's request limit changes.** Will they raise the cap? Add a higher tier? The 500 limit is their biggest complaint.
- **Windsurf's free tier durability.** Loss leaders don't last forever. When does monetization pressure hit?
- **Copilot's response.** Microsoft has infinite resources but slow reflexes. When do they actually compete on features?
- **Agent maturity.** All three are racing to be the autonomous coding tool. Who ships something that actually works?
