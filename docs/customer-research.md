## Outreach Strategy

### Cold Email Template - AI Coding Company

**Subject:** Competitive intel for [Company] - quick question

```
Hi [Name],

I'm building Briefing - automated competitive intelligence for AI coding tools. I track pricing changes, GitHub activity, release velocity, community sentiment, and developer adoption across the space.

Noticed [Company] just [recent event - launch/funding/feature]. Congrats!

Quick question: How are you currently tracking competitors like [Competitor 1] and [Competitor 2]? Manual checking? Alerts?

If you're spending more than 30 min/week on this, Briefing might save you time. I can show you what the data looks like - no pitch, just the actual intel.

Worth a 15-min call?

### Cold Email Template - DevEx Leader

**Subject:** AI coding tool benchmarks for [Company]

```
Hi [Name],

Building a competitive intelligence service for AI coding tools (Copilot, Cursor, Codeium, etc). I track real data: pricing, releases, GitHub stars, community size, benchmark scores.

Figured it might be useful for teams evaluating these tools. I publish some data publicly at kell.cx/data - but the daily briefings have more depth.

If [Company] is evaluating AI coding tools, happy to share what I'm seeing in the market. No strings.

## Notes

The value prop for each segment differs:

- **AI Coding Companies:** "Know when competitors change pricing or release features before your customers ask"
- **DevEx Teams:** "Data-driven tool selection instead of vibes"
- **Investors:** "Real-time market intelligence for due diligence"

Pricing should scale with company size. Indie/seed = $49/mo, Series A+ = $149/mo, Enterprise = custom.
