---

## Primary Segments

### 1. VCs & Investors (HIGH VALUE)

**Who:** Partners and analysts at VC firms investing in developer tools, AI infrastructure, or coding startups.

**Pain point:** Making informed investment decisions requires understanding market dynamics, adoption trends, and competitive positioning — data that's fragmented and time-consuming to gather.

**Use case:**
- Due diligence on AI coding tool investments
- Portfolio company benchmarking
- Market sizing and trend analysis

**Willingness to pay:** HIGH ($500-2000/mo for quality data)  
**Volume:** LOW (hundreds of relevant firms)  
**Outreach:** Direct email, LinkedIn, VC Twitter/X

**Example prospects:**
- Andreessen Horowitz (invested in GitHub)
- Index Ventures (invested in Sourcegraph)
- Spark Capital (invested in Cursor)
- Kleiner Perkins (AI portfolio)

### 2. Product Managers at AI Coding Companies (CORE)

**Who:** PMs at Cursor, GitHub, Codeium, Tabnine, Replit, JetBrains, etc.

**Pain point:** Need to track competitors' pricing changes, feature releases, hiring signals, and community sentiment — but it's a time sink to monitor manually.

**Use case:**
- Competitive positioning
- Pricing strategy
- Feature prioritization based on competitor gaps

**Willingness to pay:** MEDIUM ($200-500/mo, company pays)  
**Volume:** MEDIUM (50-100 relevant companies, multiple PMs each)

**Key insight:** These people ARE the subject of our research. Slight weirdness factor ("you're tracking me") but also validates relevance.

---

### 3. Enterprise DevTools Buyers (EMERGING)

**Who:** Engineering leaders, DevEx teams, and procurement at large enterprises evaluating AI coding tools.

**Pain point:** Choosing between GitHub Copilot, Codeium, Cursor, etc. for team-wide deployment requires objective comparison data.

**Willingness to pay:** MEDIUM ($500-1000/mo during eval period)  
**Volume:** HIGH (thousands of enterprises)  
**Outreach:** LinkedIn, Gartner/Forrester visibility, enterprise sales

**Complication:** May only need data for 3-6 month evaluation window, not ongoing.

---

### 4. Strategy Consultants (OPPORTUNISTIC)

**Who:** McKinsey, BCG, Bain, Accenture tech strategy teams; boutique DevTools consultants.

**Pain point:** Client engagements require rapid market understanding; manual research is expensive.

**Use case:**

**Willingness to pay:** HIGH ($1000-5000/mo or per-engagement)  
**Volume:** LOW-MEDIUM  
**Outreach:** Partner networks, direct outreach to tech practice leads

---

### 5. Developer Relations & Marketing (ADJACENT)
