# The State of AI Coding Assistants: February 2026

*Real data on who's winning, who's raising, and where the market is headed.*

---

The AI coding assistant market has exploded. In just two years, we've gone from "will developers actually use this?" to a multi-billion dollar race with over a dozen serious contenders.

I track this space daily. Here's what the data actually shows.

## Market Share by Developer Adoption

VS Code Marketplace installs tell a clear story:

| Tool | Installs | Rating | 
|------|----------|--------|
| **GitHub Copilot** | 71.1M | 4.11/5 |
| **Copilot Chat** | 60.8M | 3.59/5 |
| **Tabnine** | 9.5M | 4.03/5 |
| **Codeium/Windsurf** | 3.5M | 4.76/5 |
| **Continue** | 2.1M | 3.78/5 |
| **Amazon Q** | 1.5M | 4.11/5 |
| **Sourcegraph Cody** | 796K | 3.98/5 |
| **Supermaven** | 360K | 3.77/5 |

*Data as of February 11, 2026*

**GitHub Copilot dominates** with 71 million installs — but that's not the whole story.

Codeium has the highest rating (4.76/5) despite fewer installs. Continue and Supermaven are gaining ground in the open-source and speed-focused niches.

## The New Wave: Agentic Coding

The biggest shift isn't in autocomplete — it's in **agentic coding tools** that can handle entire tasks:

- **Cursor** — Forked VS Code into an AI-first editor. Raised at rumored $1B+ valuation.
- **Devin (Cognition AI)** — The "AI software engineer" that sparked the agentic coding trend. $21B valuation.
- **Windsurf (Codeium)** — Pivoted from autocomplete to a full agentic IDE.
- **Bolt.new (StackBlitz)** — AI web app builder in browser. Zero setup.
- **Lovable** — AI fullstack engineer. Hit $6.6B valuation.
- **Poolside AI** — The stealth player. Nvidia-backed at $20B valuation.

This is where the action is. Autocomplete is becoming commoditized. The premium is in tools that can plan, execute, and iterate.

## Funding Race

Valuations have gone vertical:

- **Poolside AI** — $20B (Nvidia-backed, training models from scratch)
- **Cognition AI (Devin)** — $21B 
- **Lovable** — $6.6B
- **Cursor (Anysphere)** — $1B+ (rumored)
- **Replit** — $1.16B (2023)
- **Codeium** — $1.25B (2024)

The money is chasing agentic capabilities. Investors are betting these tools will replace significant portions of junior developer work within 2-3 years.

## Hiring Signals

Job postings reveal company trajectories:

- **Poolside AI** — 19 open roles (building out rapidly)
- **Cursor** — ~10 LinkedIn results (lean team, high output)
- **Sourcegraph** — 6 roles (refocused on Cody)

Poolside's aggressive hiring suggests they're racing to release something. Cursor staying lean suggests they're confident in their current team. Both valid strategies, very different signals.

## What to Watch

**Pricing pressure is coming.** Copilot at $19/month looks expensive when Codeium offers free tiers and Cursor provides more functionality at $20/month.

**Enterprise is the real battleground.** Consumer installs matter, but the revenue is in enterprise contracts. Copilot's Microsoft backing gives them distribution. Everyone else is fighting for the rest.

**Open source alternatives are maturing.** Continue's 2.1M installs show developers want control. This will pressure proprietary pricing.

**Agentic tools need to prove ROI.** Cursor and Windsurf are great for power users. But enterprises need metrics before deploying AI that writes code autonomously.
