Hi [NAME],

Building [COMPANY] in the AI coding space means keeping tabs on Cursor, Devin, Windsurf, Copilot, and the rest. That's a lot of changelog pages, job boards, and pricing pages to refresh.

I built a tool that does it automatically.

Every morning at 6am UTC, it delivers:
- Changelog updates from all major AI coding tools
- New job postings (hiring = expanding; layoffs = pivoting)
- Pricing page changes (before your customers notice)
- HN/Reddit mentions and sentiment
- GitHub activity on key repos

No dashboard to check. Just a 2-minute email digest.

Currently sending it to [N] teams in the space. Want in?

Reply "yes" and I'll add you.

## Personalization Notes

For each prospect, add:
1. Something specific about their product/company
2. Which competitor they're most likely watching
3. Recent news about them (if any)
