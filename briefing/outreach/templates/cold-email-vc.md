Hi [NAME],

You've invested in [PORTFOLIO COMPANY] / been tracking the AI coding tools space.

The market moves fast—Cursor hit $300M ARR, Devin crossed $73M, new players launch weekly. Keeping up is a job in itself.

I run a daily briefing that aggregates:
- Product updates from 11 major players (Cursor, Devin, Windsurf, Copilot, etc.)
- Hiring signals (who's scaling, who's restructuring)
- Pricing changes
- Community sentiment (HN, Reddit, GitHub)

5-minute read, every morning. No dashboard, no login—just email.

Useful for portfolio companies in the space or for DD on new deals.

Happy to add you if helpful.

## Personalization Notes

1. Reference their portfolio company in dev tools if any
2. Mention recent investment or public thesis on AI
3. Keep it shorter than founder version—VCs get more email
