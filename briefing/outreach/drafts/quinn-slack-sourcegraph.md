# Draft: Quinn Slack (Sourcegraph)

**To:** Quinn Slack
**Company:** Sourcegraph
**Subject:** What Copilot and Cursor shipped this week

---

Hey Quinn,

Cody's competing with Copilot, Cursor, and a wave of well-funded challengers. Staying on top of their moves—changelogs, hiring, pricing—burns hours that should go to product.

I automated it. Daily email at 6am UTC covering 11 AI coding tools:
- Changelog updates (Cursor, Copilot, Windsurf, etc.)
- Job postings—hiring patterns reveal strategy
- Pricing page changes
- HN, Reddit, GitHub mentions and releases

2-minute scan. No login, no dashboard.

Sourcegraph's enterprise play depends on staying ahead of Copilot's feature parity. This briefing keeps that visible.

Want in? Reply "yes" and I'll add you.

**Notes:**
- CEO perspective—strategic, enterprise-focused
- Cody is their AI product, direct competition with tracked tools
- Already drafted Beyang (CTO)—Quinn is the business angle
- Email likely: quinn@ sourcegraph.com
- Angle: enterprise positioning requires competitive awareness
