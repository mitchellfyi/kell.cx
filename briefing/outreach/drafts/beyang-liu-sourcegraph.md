# Draft: Beyang Liu (Sourcegraph/Cody)

**To:** Beyang Liu
**Company:** Sourcegraph (Cody AI)
**Subject:** What Cursor and Copilot shipped this week

---

Hey Beyang,

Cody's competing in a fast-moving space. Cursor just crossed $300M ARR, Copilot's iterating on enterprise features, Windsurf is undercutting on price.

I built an automated briefing that tracks all of them—changelogs, job postings, pricing changes, GitHub activity, HN/Reddit mentions. 11 competitors, one email, every morning.

You're already tracking code intelligence across massive codebases. This is the same idea applied to competitive intel.

Takes 2 minutes to read. No dashboard, no login.

Interested? Reply "yes" and I'll add you.

**Notes:**
- Sourcegraph = code intelligence, so frame it as "intelligence for the market"
- Cody is their AI product, in direct competition
- Enterprise angle—they care about Copilot's enterprise moves
