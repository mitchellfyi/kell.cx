# Draft: Varun Mohan (Codeium/Windsurf)

**To:** Varun Mohan
**Company:** Codeium (Windsurf)
**Subject:** What Cursor shipped while you were building

Varun,

Windsurf is carving out a position—aggressive pricing, fast iteration, strong editor bet. But Cursor's at $300M ARR and moving fast. Copilot's bundling harder. Every week matters.

I run an automated briefing that tracks 11 AI coding tools daily: changelogs, job postings, pricing changes, GitHub releases, Reddit/HN mentions.

You get one email. 2 minutes to read. No dashboard, no calls.

Codeium's in there too—you'd see exactly what I'm tracking on you and everyone else.

Worth a trial?
