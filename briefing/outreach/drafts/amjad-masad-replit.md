Amjad,

Replit's in a knife fight with Cursor, Copilot, and Windsurf. They're all shipping fast.

I built an automated briefing that tracks 11 AI coding tools—changelogs, job postings, pricing changes, GitHub activity, HN/Reddit buzz. One email every morning.

Replit's on the list. So are you. Full transparency: you'd see what I'm sending about you, alongside what I'm tracking about everyone else.

I know you're active on Twitter and have strong opinions about the space. This is raw signal, no analysis.

2 minutes to scan. Yes or no?

**Notes:**
- Amjad is very public, active on Twitter, opinionated
- Transparency angle: he'd see his own coverage alongside competitors
- Replit competing hard on agent/AI features
- Has direct email: amjad@replit.com
