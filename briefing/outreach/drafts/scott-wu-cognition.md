Hi Scott,

Devin's trajectory is impressive—$73M ARR, $10B valuation, leading the agent race. But you know the field is crowded: Cursor at $300M ARR, Windsurf going aggressive on pricing, Copilot quietly shipping agentic features.

I built an automated briefing that tracks all of them daily:
- Changelog updates from 11 AI coding tools
- Hiring signals (who's scaling engineering, who's cutting)
- Pricing page changes
- HN/Reddit/GitHub mentions and sentiment

6am UTC email. No dashboard, no login. 2-minute read.

Probably overkill for a well-funded team with PMs tracking this—but founders I've talked to like having one less thing to manually check.

Happy to add you if useful.

## Notes
- He's IOI gold medalist, technical founder—keep it data-focused
- Cognition is well-resourced but founder might still appreciate automated intel
- Don't oversell; acknowledge they probably have resources
- Meta angle: we track Devin too, but leading with that feels weird
