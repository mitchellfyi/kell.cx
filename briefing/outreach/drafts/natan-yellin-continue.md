# Draft: Natan Yellin (Continue.dev)

**To:** Natan Yellin
**Company:** Continue.dev
**Subject:** What the proprietary players shipped this week

Hey Natan,

Continue.dev is the open source alternative in a space dominated by well-funded proprietary tools. Knowing what Cursor, Copilot, Windsurf, and Devin are shipping helps you decide what to build (and what to skip).

I run a daily briefing that tracks 11 AI coding tools:
- Changelog updates
- Job postings (hiring = strategy signals)
- Pricing changes
- HN/Reddit sentiment
- GitHub releases

2-minute email, every morning at 6am UTC. No dashboard to check.

Useful for spotting what features are becoming table stakes vs. what's still differentiated.

Want in? Reply "yes".

**Notes:**
- Continue is open source—they're the underdog, need intel more than big players
- YC-backed, so likely scrappy and appreciates automation
- Frame it as competitive intel for product decisions
