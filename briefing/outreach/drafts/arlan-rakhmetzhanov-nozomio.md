# Draft: Arlan Rakhmetzhanov (Nozomio)

**To:** Arlan Rakhmetzhanov
**Company:** Nozomio (YC S25)
**Subject:** Your competitors are shipping faster than you can track

Hey Arlan,

Congrats on YC S25. Building an AI coding agent means you're going head-to-head with Cursor, Devin, and Windsurf—plus a dozen others raising hundreds of millions.

Keeping tabs on their moves is a full-time job you don't have time for.

I built an automated briefing that tracks 11 AI coding tools daily:
- Changelogs and product updates
- Job postings (hiring = roadmap signals)
- Pricing page changes
- HN/Reddit/GitHub mentions and releases

One email, 6am UTC, 2-minute read. No dashboards.

You're early stage—intel on what's working for competitors could save you from building the wrong thing.

Want the briefing? Reply "yes" and I'll add you.

**Notes:**
- YC S25 = early stage, scrappy, limited resources
- Direct competitor to the companies tracked
- Find email: arlan@ nozomio.com, or via YC directory / LinkedIn
- Angle: intel helps avoid wasted effort, stay ahead of funded giants
