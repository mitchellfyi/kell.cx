Hi Guy,

Congrats on Tessl—"spec-driven development" feels like the right evolution for secure AI-assisted coding. Given your Snyk background, you're probably watching how Cursor, Copilot, and Devin handle security (or don't).

I run a daily briefing that tracks the AI coding tool market:
- Product updates from 11 players (changelogs, feature launches)
- Hiring signals (security hires = they're taking it seriously)
- Pricing moves
- HN/Reddit/GitHub chatter

The security angle is interesting—as these tools get more autonomous, the attack surface grows. Might be useful intel for positioning Tessl.

Happy to add you if helpful.
