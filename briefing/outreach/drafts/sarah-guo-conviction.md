# Draft: Sarah Guo (Conviction)

**To:** Sarah Guo
**Company:** Conviction (VC)
**Subject:** AI coding tools market intel for your portfolio

Hey Sarah,

You're deep in AI investing with No Priors. AI coding tools are one of the hottest battlegrounds—Cursor at $300M ARR, Devin at $10B valuation, Windsurf going free.

I built a daily briefing tracking 11 AI coding tools:
- Changelog updates (what they're shipping)
- Job postings (where they're investing)
- Pricing changes (competitive positioning)
- HN/Reddit/GitHub sentiment + releases

Useful for:
- Due diligence on new AI coding deals
- Portfolio company intel (if you're in this space)
- Market context for the No Priors audience

2-minute read, 6am UTC, just email. No dashboards.

Might be useful for your deal flow. Want it?

**Notes:**
- Different angle: investor, not operator
- No Priors podcast = public interest in AI market dynamics
- Conviction portfolio may include AI coding adjacent companies
- LinkedIn DM likely best—VCs rarely have public emails
- Value prop: better DD, market context, podcast fodder
