# Draft: Jacob Jackson (Supermaven)

**To:** Jacob Jackson
**Company:** Supermaven
**Subject:** Cursor and Windsurf shipped updates this week

---

Hey Jacob,

Running Supermaven means watching what Cursor, Windsurf, Copilot, and the rest are doing. Changelog pages, job boards, pricing—it's a lot to track when you're also building.

I automated it. Every morning at 6am UTC, I send a digest covering:
- Changelogs from 11 AI coding tools
- New job postings (hiring patterns = strategy signals)
- Pricing page changes
- HN/Reddit/GitHub mentions

2-minute read. No login, no dashboard—just email.

You're focused on speed and autocomplete quality. Knowing when competitors change their completion models or pricing helps you stay sharp.

Want in? Reply "yes" and I'll add you.

**Notes:**
- Supermaven's angle is speed/performance
- Jacob is ex-Tabnine, knows the space deeply
- Smaller team = more likely to appreciate automated intel
