Hi Elad,

You've been active in the AI coding tools space—invested in several players and written about the market dynamics.

I built an automated briefing that tracks the landscape daily:
- Product updates from Cursor, Devin, Windsurf, Copilot, and 7 others
- Hiring signals (scaling vs restructuring)
- Pricing page changes
- Community sentiment (HN, Reddit, GitHub)

6am UTC email, 5-minute read. Useful for DD on new deals or keeping portfolio companies informed.

Happy to add you if helpful.
