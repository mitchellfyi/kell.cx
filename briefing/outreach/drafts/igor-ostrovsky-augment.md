# Draft: Igor Ostrovsky (Augment Code)

**To:** Igor Ostrovsky
**Company:** Augment Code
**Subject:** Enterprise AI coding intel—Copilot, Cursor, the field

Igor,

Augment's playing the enterprise game. That means you're not just competing on features—you're competing on procurement narratives, security posture, and whatever Copilot's enterprise team shipped last week.

I built an automated briefing that tracks 11 AI coding tools: changelogs, job postings (including enterprise hires), pricing changes, HN/Reddit signal. Daily email, 2 minutes.

Enterprise buyers ask "what's everyone else doing?" You'd have the answer before the call.

Interested? Just reply.

**Notes:**
- Ex-Microsoft, enterprise focus
- Augment raised significant funding, going after enterprise
- Frame: procurement/competitive intel angle
- They'd want Copilot Enterprise intel specifically
- Email: likely igor@augmentcode.com or find via LinkedIn
