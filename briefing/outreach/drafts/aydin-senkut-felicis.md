# Outreach Draft: Aydin Senkut (Felicis)

**To:** Aydin Senkut, Founder & Managing Partner @ Felicis
**Subject:** AI coding tools competitive intel (for DD)

---

Aydin,

You've backed some of the most important developer tools of the last decade (Plaid, Notion, Shopify). The AI coding assistant space is now the hottest corner of that market—$300M ARR for Cursor, $6.6B valuation for Lovable, Cognition at $10B.

I built Briefing (kell.cx) to track this space daily:

- Changelog scraping for Cursor, Codeium, Copilot, Devin
- Hiring velocity (job post counts over time)
- Pricing page changes
- VS Code Marketplace install trends
- Funding news aggregation
- HN/Reddit/ProductHunt mentions
- Momentum scoring across 15 competitors

The output: a daily digest showing who's shipping, who's hiring, who's getting buzz.

**For a DevTools investor**: this is DD infrastructure. When a founder pitches you an AI coding tool, you'd have 90 days of historical signal on their competitors—not just their deck.

Want me to send you a sample briefing? Takes 30 seconds to skim.

Best,
Kell

**Personalization notes:**
- References his actual portfolio (Plaid, Notion, Shopify)
- Positions as DD tool, not a product he'd buy personally
- Concrete use case: when founder pitches, you have context
- Short, respectful of time
- No fake urgency

**Status:** Draft ready
**Next:** Find email or LinkedIn
